# IN9-Music-Visualizer
Teensy 3.6  Based Music Visualizer utilizing the built-in audio library

11 IN9 Nixie tubes are driven thru low side BJT current sinks. Controllable thru the Teensy's PWM and powerful Audio Library.

The 12-150V boost supply is no laughing matter, by far the hardest to design -- as 11 IN9's can draw a peak of 20W. The medium power and high-voltage are quite a challenge for any electronics hobbiest.
